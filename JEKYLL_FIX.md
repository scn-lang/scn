# 🔧 Jekyll Build Issue - FIXED

## ❌ **Problem Identified**
GitHub Pages was trying to use Jekyll to build your Astro site, which caused the error:
```
Invalid YAML front matter in /github/workspace/src/components/Hero.astro
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Updated Workflow Configuration**
Added `static_site_generator: astro` to the workflow:
```yaml
- name: Setup Pages
  uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
  with:
    static_site_generator: astro
```

### 2. **Added .nojekyll File**
Created `public/.nojekyll` to disable Jekyll processing:
- This tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll entirely
- Allows Astro's static files to be served directly

## 🚀 **Ready for Deployment**

Your GitHub Pages deployment should now work correctly because:

1. ✅ **Astro Build Process** - Uses your custom Astro workflow
2. ✅ **No Jekyll Interference** - `.nojekyll` file prevents Jekyll processing
3. ✅ **Proper Static Site Generator** - Workflow configured for Astro
4. ✅ **Clean Build Output** - Serves files from `./dist` directory

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Commit and push the fixes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Jekyll interference - add .nojekyll and configure Astro workflow"
git push origin main
```

2. **Monitor the deployment:**
- Go to repository **Actions** tab
- Watch for successful "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- Should complete without Jekyll errors

3. **Verify your site:**
- Check your live site at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME/`
- Test all navigation and functionality

## 🛠️ **What Was Fixed**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Jekyll trying to process Astro files | Added `static_site_generator: astro` |
| YAML front matter errors | Added `.nojekyll` file |
| Wrong build process | Configured proper Astro workflow |

## 🎉 **Deployment Should Now Succeed**

The GitHub Pages deployment will now:
1. Use Node.js 20 with npm caching
2. Install dependencies with `npm ci`
3. Build with Astro (`npm run build`)
4. Skip Jekyll processing entirely
5. Deploy static files from `./dist`

Your professional SCN website should be live shortly after pushing these changes!
