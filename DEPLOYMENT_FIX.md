# 🔧 GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem:** GitHub Actions couldn't find the lock file and had Node.js version mismatch.

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Generated `package-lock.json` for npm compatibility
2. ✅ Updated workflow to use Node.js 20 (matches Astro requirements)
3. ✅ Fixed npm caching configuration
4. ✅ Changed to `npm ci` for faster, reliable installs

## 📁 Updated Files

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Updated Node.js version from 18 to 20
- Re-enabled npm caching (now works with package-lock.json)
- Changed back to `npm ci` for production builds

### `package-lock.json`
- Generated npm lock file for GitHub Actions compatibility
- Ensures consistent dependency versions across environments

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

Your deployment should now work correctly. The workflow will:

1. ✅ Use Node.js 20 (compatible with Astro 5.12.0)
2. ✅ Cache npm dependencies for faster builds
